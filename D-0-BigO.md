Good Code: 
1. Readable
2. Scalable (BigO)
2.1. Speed (The usual BigO - Time complexity)
2.2. Memory (Space Complexity)

"Using Big O, which code is better than the other ?"
"When we grow bigger and bigger how much the function slow down? Algorithmic efficiency" "LESS IT SLOWS DOWN IS BETTER"
"Number of operations can increase really really much"
"How many steps it takes in a function?"
Rule-1: Worst Case
Rule-2: Remove constants
Rule-3: Different terms for inputs
Rule-4: Drop non dominants

O(n): Once through the whole array
O(1): At once!
O(n!): A new loop for every n

Heap: Variables
Stack: Functions

Space complexity:
Variables
Data structures
Function call
Allocations
